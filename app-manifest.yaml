  long_description: Sensitive Koala allows workspaces such as newsrooms to safely share sensitive images in channel without disturbing coworkers. Through a global action or a message action, users can input a URL to a sensitive image and Sensitive Koala will post a button that would open the image in a modal, instead of letting Slack unfurl it.
