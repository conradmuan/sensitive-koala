Sensitive Koala is a Slack bot that hides sensitive images behind a modal. This is useful for newsrooms who need to share sensitive images in public channels, or for innocuous things like hiding spoilers for the next Marvel movie.

Requires users to host images outside of slack

‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution:** This bot assumes links to images are valid. It does not validate images and will silently fail when trying to open a modal to the provided image url
